For all of your Mount Vernon needs
The next section is meant for my IT staff; it is assumed they would be reading this.
By this point, I'm guessing you guys are allowing this website.
Judging by the fact that it was removed from the blocklist and all, it makes sense.
I just want to know; why?
I know I'll probably never get an answer, but are you guys turning a blind eye?
Actually allowing it?
Who knows.
Anyways, goodbye.
