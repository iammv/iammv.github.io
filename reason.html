        <h2>
        Hello everyone. You might be wondering what happened to MVUnblocked from 1/23 to 2/8? Why was MVUnblocked MVBlocked for a bit? Why did the site go from .com to .github.io? Well, to start, google actually sucks. Just had to get that out of the way.
        Pretty much, it first started out with a malware warning. The reason for this is because I forgot an essential piece of websites in general, SSL and TLS certificates. You may be wondering; what the heck are SSL/TLS? In the simplest way possible, they secure user data between the client and server, and pretty much tell the browser that the website is legit. So I was being stupid and forgot to actually use SSL (mostly because I was used to github pages, which had automatic ssl), which made google a wee bit angry. To fix this, I hooked up my site to cloudflare and gave it ssl and other security measures.
        </h2>
        <h3>wait 2 days, nothing happens.</h3>
        <h2>and so i'm wondering what the heck is going on, if my website is actually infected with something. As a last resort, after checking the github repo (which you can actually check out <a href="https://github.com/MVUnblocked/MVUnblocked.github.io">right here!</a>), I check google search console, and it tells me that 6 pages are hosting malware. I don't think I would be hosting malware on a games website for a school, so I ask google what happened, and they just removed the html from the infected list? So, all good, right?'</h2>
        <h5>nope</h5>
        <h2>Website is now blocked by cisco. I was kinda surprised, but then I realized that the url had "Malware" in it and put two and two together and realized that it had been automatically blocked by the system. Even worse, when I would try and work on it at home, it would give a router error saying it was malicious, and the connection would keep reseting. I reverted it to .github.io for the time being, while i tried to figure out solutions. Eventually, on a whim, I completely reset everything. I remove all my nameservers, connection to cloudflare, everything. Still doesn't work. I then just do that again, and somehow, it finally gives me an actual error (which i fixed easily). I open it up and...
        </h2>
        <h1>IT WORKS</h1>
        <h2>
        so now we're back on mvunblocked.com. because localstorage was cleared, some of your saves for certain games might have been reset (may make a fix for that) Anyways, that concludes the rant from your favorite schizophrenic. if you have any other questions, email me at aiden@mvunblocked.com (yup thats right i have a cool email now)
